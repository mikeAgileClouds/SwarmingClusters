# SwarmingClusters

The goal of this project is build a tool that will orchestrate docker containers across multiple cluster infrastructures using the Swarm API.
This will demo the ability of Swarm to communicate to multiple container engines and act as a model for showing organizations the ship-ability and run-ability of docker.

Interface developer with Node.js experience 

1) To build a screen that allows for inputting a dockerfile 
2) Also inputs the required details to graphically launch and show the movement of containers across a swarm cluster on Ranger and a swarm cluster on Mesosphere DCOS. 

Swarm Expert who can

1) Build a routine that leverage machine and swarm to launch a cluster in Rancher and a cluster in DOCS.   
2) Build a routine to launch a container with Swarm to the selected cluster.
